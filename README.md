# Batch_Simulation_for_bent_tube_and_springback_after

#### This programe was uesd before for datasets construction in all my works and my research group mate
#### Besides this version, the Bi-layer tube simulation are also achieved (will be uploaded after)

#### This programe can achieve bacth sample, bending process and springback process one by one 
#### The final result is inp. file, which can be conversed to txt. file for extraction

#### This program is an example for batch extraction, and the example of process file are given

#### By Sun Chang and Zhou taotao
#### Zhejiang University
#### For any further program and question, contact sun_chang@zju.edu.cn
